# sisy Script Overview made by AI

## Description
The `sisy` is designed to provide comprehensive system information on Linux-based operating systems. It is meant to be a versatile tool that collects and displays essential details about the system's hardware, software, and usage statistics.

## Requirements

To run `sisy` without issues, ensure the following:

1. **Operating System**:
   - Linux-based operating system (e.g., Ubuntu, Fedora, Debian, Arch).

2. **Dependencies**:
   - Basic Linux utilities (`awk`, `grep`, `sed`, `cut`, `awk`).
   - Additional utilities for CPU and GPU monitoring:
     - `lm-sensors` for CPU temperature.
     - `nvidia-smi` for Nvidia GPU temperature.
     - `radeontop` for AMD GPU temperature.
     - `intel-gpu-tools` for Intel GPU temperature.

3. **Root or Sudo Access**:
   - Some commands (especially those fetching GPU temperatures) may require root or sudo privileges.

## Installation of Dependencies

Install necessary utilities using your package manager. Examples:

# Install lm-sensors for CPU temperature
``sudo apt-get install lm-sensors``

# Install nvidia-smi for Nvidia GPU temperature
``sudo apt-get install nvidia-smi``

# Install radeontop for AMD GPU temperature
``sudo apt-get install radeontop``

# Install intel-gpu-tools for Intel GPU temperature
``sudo apt-get install intel-gpu-tools``

## Features
- **Operating System Information**: Displays OS name, kernel version, architecture, and more.
- **Hardware Information**: Provides details about the host, CPU model, cores, threads, and architecture.
- **Temperature Monitoring**: Retrieves and displays CPU and GPU temperatures using available system utilities.
- **Memory and Storage**: Shows memory (RAM) and swap usage, as well as disk usage statistics.
- **System Uptime**: Indicates how long the system has been running.
- **Package Management**: Counts installed packages using package managers.
- **User Interface Themes**: Fetches information about GTK theme, icon theme, and cursor theme.
- **Additional Information** (commented out): Includes options for displaying network interfaces, top CPU and memory-consuming processes, system logs, disk I/O statistics, and system load.

## Advantages
- **Comprehensive**: Provides a wide range of system information in a structured format.
- **Customizable**: Additional functionalities can be enabled by uncommenting specific sections of the script.
- **Utility Compatibility**: Supports multiple utilities for temperature monitoring across different hardware configurations.
- **Easy to Run**: Simply execute the script in a terminal to obtain detailed system insights.

## Disadvantages and Considerations
- **Dependency on Utilities**: Requires certain utilities to be installed and correctly configured for accurate readings.
- **Privileges**: Some commands may require root or sudo privileges for full functionality.
- **Hardware Specific**: Accuracy of temperature readings depends on hardware compatibility and monitoring utilities.
- **Linux Specific**: Designed for Linux systems; may not work on other operating systems without modifications.

## Prerequisites
- **Linux Environment**: Intended for use on Linux-based operating systems.
- **Installed Utilities**: Ensure necessary commands (`sensors`, `nvidia-smi`, `intel_gpu_top`, etc.) are available.
- **User Privileges**: Run the script with appropriate permissions to access system information.

## Usage
1. Download or create the `sisy` script (if it doesn't exist).
2. Open a terminal and navigate to the script's directory.
3. Run the script using `./sisy`.
4. Review the output to obtain detailed system information.

## Additional Notes
- Customize the script as needed by modifying or adding functionalities.
- Ensure to update system utilities and permissions as necessary for accurate and secure operation.
